## 6.1 Backbone Like
Using a Backbone model and events, I built a like button. The button keeps track of how many times it has been clicked and updates its count each time it is clicked again. This assignment enabled me to practice using .get, .set, .on, and .toJSON on an instance of Backbone.Model. In addition, I practiced using jQuery event listeners to change a Backbone model instance.
